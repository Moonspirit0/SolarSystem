    <h1>Our Solar System</h1>

    <p>
        There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The current count orbiting our star: eight.
        <br>
        The inner, rocky planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. NASA's newest rover — Perseverance — landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. The outer planets are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.
        <br>
        Beyond Neptune, a newer class of smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign, including longtime favorite Pluto. Thousands more planets have been discovered beyond our solar system. Scientists call them exoplanets (exo means "from outside.")

    <h3>What is a Planet?</h3>
    <p>
        This seemingly simple question doesn't have a simple answer. Everyone knows that Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets. But both Pluto and Ceres were once considered planets until new discoveries triggered scientific debate about how to best describe them—a vigorous debate that continues to this day. The most recent definition of a planet was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. It says a planet must do three things:
        <br>
    <ol>
        <li>It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun).</li>
        <li>It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.</li>
        <li>It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Discussion—and debate—will continue as our view of the cosmos continues to expand.</p>
